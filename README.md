# mongodb-loadgenerator

Thanks to Michal Krzek-Lubowiecki for most of the source code.

# To run on centOS
```
sudo yum install nodejs
# update url in mongoProvider.js & test cases in generate.js
# fix firewalls
npm install
npm run start
```
The POCDriver load generator could also be interesting. It has more configuration options, whereas this one is easy to understand and modify directly.
